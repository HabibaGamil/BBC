Directory app is responsible for retrieving post metadatas that belong to certain categories/ subcategories/ topics. 
Furthermore, it is used to obtain information about each category, such as its name and the subcategories falling under it. 
Similarily, it is used to obtain information about each subcategory and topic. 

To run the directory app, you first need to install elasticsearch and you may as well need kibana which is an interactive interface to simplity the process of making api requests.
You can install elasticsearch and kibana using this url: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases#elasticsearch and make sure you set the version to 7.17.9 since this is used in the app.
